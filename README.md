# About Me

Ahoy! My name is `jengryg`. I build stuff with code since the mid 2000s.

Here you can find some of my (non-professional) side-projects I do when I am not busy building solutions for employers.

## Repositories regarding my research in stochastic geometry

* [random-geometric-structures](https://github.com/jengryg/random-geometric-structures) modernized Kotlin
  implementations, using improved algorithms and parallelization
* [random-simplicial-complex-thesis-figures](https://github.com/jengryg/random-simplicial-complex-thesis-figures) the
  implementation in Java that I used for my php-thesis
* [random-simplicial-complex-java-legacy](https://github.com/jengryg/random-simplicial-complex-java-legacy) the old
  implementations in Java just for archival purpose

## Repositories regarding my side projects

These repositories are used mainly as a playground for me to try out ideas on implementations and architecture, learn
new things or just having fun with code.

### Doppelkopf

Implementation of the trick-taking card game Doppelkopf, hopefully sometime I will finish it.

* [doppelkopf-srv](https://github.com/jengryg/doppelkopf-srv) Backend (Spring Boot, Kotlin/Java)
* [doppelkopf-ui](https://github.com/jengryg/doppelkopf-ui) Frontend (Angular, Typescript, Bootstrap)
* [doppelkopf-cicd](https://github.com/jengryg/doppelkopf-cicd) Helm Chart

### Tools I created because I needed to solve something

* [game-tools-civ-idle-calculator](https://github.com/jengryg/game-tools-civ-idle-calculator)
* [game-tools-big-ambitions-calculator](https://github.com/jengryg/game-tools-big-ambitions-calculator)
* [duplication-finder](https://github.com/jengryg/duplication-finder)
* [pp-json-to-spreadsheet-converter](https://github.com/jengryg/pp-json-to-spreadsheet-converter)

## Dev Setup

Repository [dev-setup](https://github.com/jengryg/dev-setup) contains scripts, configurations, snippets and
documentation for my local workstation setup.
